## Introduction:
The Appraisal Portal, built on Java Spring Boot, digitizes and streamlines the performance appraisal process. It offers employees a centralized platform for self-appraisal submission and enables managers to review, evaluate, and provide feedback efficiently.

## Problem Statement:
The current manual appraisal process involves employees self-assessing their performance, which is then evaluated by managers or mentors. This approach is labor-intensive, lacks transparency, and hinders effective performance assessment.

## Proposed Solution:
We're implementing a Java Spring Boot application to create a centralized digital portal for employee appraisals. Employees securely log in to access and submit assessments, which are then evaluated by managers, with final approval by the HR department.

## Benefits of the Solution:
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** The digitalization of the appraisal process streamlines workflows, reducing manual efforts and expediting the evaluation cycle.
- **Improved Communication:** The digital portal facilitates seamless communication among employees, managers, and HR, enabling effective collaboration and communication of expectations and objectives.

## Features:

### 1. User Authentication:
- Secure login functionality for both employees and managers ensures data privacy and access control.

### 2. Digital Appraisal Form:
- Employees can conveniently access the digital appraisal form through the portal.
- The form encompasses comprehensive sections covering various aspects of performance evaluation, including achievements, challenges, goals, and self-assessment.

### 3. Manager Review:
- Submitted appraisal forms are instantly accessible to designated managers for review.
- Managers can thoroughly evaluate employee performance based on the provided self-assessment and additional performance metrics.

### 4. Rating Submission:
- Managers can provide ratings and constructive feedback on different performance parameters directly within the portal.
- The system ensures that ratings and feedback are securely recorded and associated with the respective employee.
