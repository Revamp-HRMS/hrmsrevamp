## Introduction:
The Appraisal Portal is a Java Spring Boot application designed to digitize and streamline the employee performance appraisal process within the organization. This portal provides a centralized platform for employees to submit self-appraisals and for managers to review, evaluate, and provide feedback, facilitating a more efficient and transparent appraisal workflow.

## Problem Statement:
The current appraisal process within our organization is manual and involves employees individually completing appraisal documents and self-assessing their performance. These documents are then submitted to managers or mentors for further evaluation, where ratings are assigned based on the employee's self-assessment. This approach is labor-intensive, prone to inaccuracies, and lacks transparency, hindering our ability to effectively assess employee performance and provide meaningful feedback.

## Proposed Solution:
To address these challenges, we are implementing a comprehensive solution leveraging a Java Spring Boot application. This application will establish a centralized digital portal tailored for the employee appraisal process. Through this portal, employees will securely log in, access the digital appraisal form, and electronically submit their assessments. Subsequently, the submitted forms will be routed to the respective managers for evaluation. Managers will then provide ratings and constructive feedback within the digital platform. Upon completion, the appraisal forms will be  forwarded to the HR department for final review and approval.

## Benefits of the Solution:
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** The digitalization of the appraisal process streamlines workflows, reducing manual efforts and expediting the evaluation cycle.
- **Improved Communication:** The digital portal facilitates seamless communication among employees, managers, and HR, enabling effective collaboration and communication of expectations and objectives.

## Features:

### 1. User Authentication:
- Secure login functionality for both employees and managers ensures data privacy and access control.

### 2. Digital Appraisal Form:
- Employees can conveniently access the digital appraisal form through the portal.
- The form encompasses comprehensive sections covering various aspects of performance evaluation, including achievements, challenges, goals, and self-assessment.

### 3. Manager Review:
- Submitted appraisal forms are instantly accessible to designated managers for review.
- Managers can thoroughly evaluate employee performance based on the provided self-assessment and additional performance metrics.

### 4. Rating Submission:
- Managers can provide ratings and constructive feedback on different performance parameters directly within the portal.
- The system ensures that ratings and feedback are securely recorded and associated with the respective employee.

### 5. HR Approval:
- After the manager submits their ratings and feedback, the appraisal form is automatically forwarded to the HR department for final approval.
- HR personnel can review the submitted evaluations and ensure consistency and fairness across the organization.


## Usage:

1. **Employee Workflow:**
   - Employees log in using their credentials and access the appraisal form from their dashboard.
   - They fill out the appraisal form thoroughly, providing honest self-assessment and relevant details.
   - After completing the form, employees submit it for manager review.

2. **Manager Workflow:**
   - Managers receive notifications or access to review submitted appraisal forms from their dashboard.
   - They carefully review the employee's self-appraisal, evaluate performance metrics, and provide ratings and feedback.
   - Once satisfied with the evaluation, managers submit the ratings, which are then forwarded to HR.

3. **HR Approval:**
   - HR personnel access the submitted appraisal forms and ensure the consistency and fairness of evaluations.
   - They can review ratings provided by managers and finalize the appraisal process.
